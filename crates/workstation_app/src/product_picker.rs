//! The product chooser: grouped, searchable, and driven from the keyboard.
//!
//! What this replaces is a flat `ComboBox` of all seventeen products in one
//! undifferentiated column. Nothing on screen said what a product measured,
//! what unit it came back in, or whether the volume on screen could draw it at
//! all, and reaching any of it needed a mouse. During a warning that is the
//! wrong instrument.
//!
//! Three rules hold this file together.
//!
//! * Every product fact it shows is read from `product_engine`'s registry:
//!   group, label, aliases, unit, declared range, citation - and the colour
//!   family from the render path that installs it. This file declares no
//!   second catalog. The last time product facts lived in two places they
//!   drifted, which is the reason the registry exists at all.
//! * It reaches into the application nowhere. Everything arrives in
//!   [`ProductPickerInput`], the way the 3D shell takes `Vol3dPaneInput`, so
//!   the picker can be tested without a `WorkstationApp`.
//! * A product this volume cannot draw stays on screen, greyed, with the
//!   reason beside it. Hiding it makes a correctly working application look
//!   broken: "where did ZDR go" is a support call, "no ZDR in this volume" is
//!   an answer.
