//! The number under the cursor, read out of the sweep the pane is actually
//! drawing.
//!
//! A probe that samples a different sweep, a different gate, or a different
//! geometry from the one on screen is worse than no probe at all: it reads out
//! a number for a pixel that is not there, and nothing about the readout looks
//! wrong. Every choice in this module is therefore made to agree with the
//! renderer, not to be independently correct.
//!
//! Three of those choices are worth stating up front, because each of them is
//! a way a plausible-looking probe goes wrong:
//!
//! 1. **The gate index is `((range_m - first_gate_m) / gate_spacing_m).round()`**,
//!    which is what `render2d` does. Gate `g` is therefore *centred* at
//!    `first_gate_m + g * gate_spacing_m`. The other common idiom, in which a
//!    gate spans `[g * spacing, (g + 1) * spacing)` and the index is a floor,
//!    shifts every readout by half a gate - 125 m on a NEXRAD super-resolution
//!    sweep - and no test that samples a gate centre would ever catch it.
//! 2. **The range used for that lookup is the screen distance from the radar.**
//!    The raster path applies neither `cos(elevation)` nor earth curvature: it
//!    plots slant range as if it were ground range. Agreeing with the pixel and
//!    being physically correct are therefore different things here, and this
//!    module deliberately agrees with the pixel. See [`probe_polar`].
//! 3. **Azimuth is the compass bearing `atan2(east, north)`**, not the
//!    mathematical `atan2(north, east)`. The two agree on the 45 degree
//!    diagonal and nowhere else, so a symmetric storm looks almost right under
//!    the wrong one.
