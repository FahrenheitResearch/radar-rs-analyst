//! The colour bar that says what a pane's colours mean.
//!
//! Three pieces on purpose. [`legend_layout`] is arithmetic - which span the
//! bar covers, where each label sits on it, what each label reads - and every
//! rule in it is pinned by a test that needs no window. [`legend_geometry`] is
//! the arithmetic that needs a font: how wide the column must be to hold what
//! is in it, and so where every rect sits. [`draw_legend`] turns those two into
//! shapes and decides nothing.
//!
//! The third rule, after the two below, is that the legend is exactly as wide
//! as its own contents. It used to be a fixed 54 points whatever it held, wrong
//! in both directions at once: a correlation coefficient bar labelled "0.4" to
//! "1.0" got about twice the width it needed, so an opaque box sat over the
//! radar explaining nothing, while a badge like "ASSUMED ENV" ran off the left
//! of the panel onto the storm with no backing. Both come of never measuring,
//! so both are fixed by measuring - with `egui`'s own layout, at the same
//! [`egui::FontId`] the glyphs are painted with. A character count times a
//! guessed advance is not a measurement: "0.4" and "-100" are not the same
//! width, and neither are "l" and "W" in the title's proportional font. See
//! [`measure_legend`] for the rule that keeps a BADGE from undoing all that.
//!
//! The failure this file exists to prevent is a bar that lies about its own
//! range. Every built-in reflectivity palette is fully transparent below
//! 10 dBZ, and the reflectivity domain is declared from -32 dBZ, so a bar drawn
//! straight across the declared domain hangs 42 dBZ of labels on a stretch of
//! scope that stays empty no matter what the radar returns. An analyst reading
//! weak-echo structure off the bottom third of that bar is reading nothing.
//! [`legend_span`] clips the declared domain against the part of the palette
//! that actually has ink, and refuses to produce a legend at all when the two
//! do not meet.
//!
//! The second rule is the unit split. The tick ladder is chosen in DISPLAY
//! units, because "50 kt" is the number an analyst reads off a warning, and
//! every tick is then converted BACK to engine units before it touches the bar
//! or the palette. Sampling a colour table with a knots number is a factor of
//! 1.94 error that still paints a picture that looks plausible, which is
//! exactly the kind of error that ships.
//!
//! The ladder itself is Heckbert's, via `product_engine::ticks`: Paul S.
//! Heckbert, "Nice Numbers for Graph Labels", in Andrew S. Glassner (ed.),
//! Graphics Gems, Academic Press, 1990, pp. 61-63.
