//! Navigating the 3D volume: the one place that turns pointer and keyboard
//! input into camera state, plus the controls that choose which camera flies.
//!
//! Self-contained in the style of [`super::pane`]. Everything this module needs
//! arrives in [`FlyInput`]; it reaches into the application nowhere, so the pane
//! and the renderer can still be lifted into a standalone crate by moving files
//! rather than by untangling them.
//!
//! # Why there are two cameras
//!
//! Orbit swings the eye around the box centre at a fixed radius. It is the
//! camera the pane has always had, and it is the reason a second one was asked
//! for: the radius bottoms out at [`orbit_radius_floor`], 1.45 half-widths on
//! the default box - 87 km from the centre - so the wheel stops zooming while
//! the feature under inspection is still a thumbnail, and there is no way to
//! put the eye *inside* an echo at all. Fly puts the eye at `fly_x/y/z` and lets
//! it go where it likes, including through the storm.
//!
//! Switching between them never moves the picture. Both describe a position as
//! (`yaw`, `pitch`) about the box centre, so [`Vol3d::enter_fly_mode`] can seed
//! the fly eye from the orbit eye and [`adopt_fly_eye_as_orbit`] can rewrite the
//! orbit angles from wherever the operator flew. Entering fly keeps the view
//! direction as well; leaving it cannot, because an orbit camera looks at the
//! centre by definition.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! One world unit is one box half-width, so every speed here is in half-widths
//! per second and scales with the box: the setting that crosses the 120 km box
//! in eleven seconds crosses the 360 km box in eleven seconds. Nothing here
//! needs to know how many kilometres that is.

// This module once carried its own `#![allow(dead_code)]` promising deletion
// "in the commit that pastes [the call sites] into vol3d/pane.rs" - that
// commit is this one: `pane::canvas` drives [`drive_camera`] and the pane
// toolbar surfaces [`camera_controls`]. Note the parent module's own
// `#![allow(dead_code)]` (vol3d.rs, for its ported BowEcho surface) STILL
// reaches this file - lint scoping covers children - and cannot be re-armed
// here with `#![warn(dead_code)]`, because `examples/vol3d_opacity_proof.rs`
// recompiles the whole vol3d tree standalone, where this module's entry
// points are legitimately uncalled. Narrowing that parent allow is vol3d.rs's
// own change.
