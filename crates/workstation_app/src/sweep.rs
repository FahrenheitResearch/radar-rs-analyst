//! How far round the current sweep a pane is allowed to paint.
//!
//! A live volume does not grow radial by radial. A chunk lands and 240 radials
//! exist at once, then nothing arrives for a second or two. Painting a whole
//! chunk the instant it lands makes the picture jump a quarter turn; painting
//! nothing until the cut closes leaves an empty wedge sitting over the storm.
//! This module turns those bursts into a clockwise reveal that moves at the
//! antenna's own measured rate and never runs ahead of the data.
//!
//! # What the numbers here were measured against
//!
//! KTLX 2026-08-17 07:24:02 UTC, VCP 212, a real chunked live volume decoded by
//! this repository's own tooling:
//!
//! * `time_offset_ms` rises monotonically inside every one of the 19 cuts, and
//!   consecutive radials sit 20-38 ms apart, with zero gaps over 200 ms. Those
//!   are *antenna* times, evenly spaced - a chunk hands over ~240 radials whose
//!   timestamps claim they were collected 30 ms apart, all of which arrived in
//!   the same millisecond. So the timestamps are an excellent clock for the
//!   sweep RATE and useless for ARRIVAL. That split is the whole design: the
//!   reveal is driven forward by wall-clock `elapsed_since_last`, and only its
//!   speed comes out of the radials.
//! * The antenna rate is not a constant. In that single volume it was
//!   16.5 deg/s on the 720-radial Doppler legs, 22.3 deg/s on the 720-radial
//!   surveillance legs, and 27.9-30.2 deg/s on the 360-radial upper cuts. A
//!   hardcoded rate is wrong by nearly a factor of two on half the cuts, which
//!   is why [`SweepState::rate_deg_per_s`] is always measured from the cut in
//!   hand.
//! * A real partial cut held 240 of 360 radials, running from 197.5 deg upward,
//!   through 360/0, ending at 76.5 deg: a 121 deg unswept hole straddling the
//!   seam. Wrapping is the normal case here, not an edge case.
//!
//! # Everything is counted in degrees swept from the start
//!
//! Raw azimuth arithmetic fails on exactly the case above. `76.5 - 197.5` is
//! -121, and a renderer that believes that paints backwards across the storm
//! instead of forwards across the hole. So this module works in *degrees swept
//! from the first radial of the cut*: a monotonic 0..=360 quantity built by
//! summing the forward steps the radials describe. Azimuths exist
//! only at the boundary - read off the cut on the way in, rebuilt as
//! `start + swept` on the way out - and every comparison in between happens on
//! the swept quantity, where there is no seam to straddle.

// This is a binary crate, so `pub` buys nothing from the `dead_code` lint: a
// finished and tested state machine is "never used" until a pane calls it, and
// clippy runs with `-D warnings`. Remove this once a pane drives `observe`;
// anything still reported dead then really is dead.
