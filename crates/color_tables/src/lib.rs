//! Fast color table parsing and sampling for radar renderers.

//! A [`ColorTable`] is a list of [`ColorStop`]s plus a [`SampleMode`] that says
//! what happens *between* the stops. The mode is not part of the palette: the
//! same stops drawn as flat bands and drawn as a continuous ramp are two
//! pictures of one colour scheme, and [`ColorTable::rendered`] converts between
//! them without touching a single stop. [`TableRendering`] is the two-valued
//! control an analyst actually holds.
