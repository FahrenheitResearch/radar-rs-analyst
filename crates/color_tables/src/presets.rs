// not, rather than silently painting nothing at the first gate that needs it.
//
// And its name ends with its own sampling mode. That matters because the name
// is the only string a picker row shows. A stepped table paints flat bands and
// an interpolated one paints a gradient; those are wildly different pictures of
// the same field, and a list reading "GR2Analyst Classic REF" beside "Smooth
// Classic REF" gives an analyst no way to tell which is which. Reading
// "GR2Analyst Classic REF (quantized stepped)" beside "Smooth Classic REF
// (interpolated)" answers it with no hover and no click.

// Continuously interpolated reflectivity
//
// Every reflectivity preset above this comment is stepped: each carries a
// `step:` row, so `sample` quantises the gate's dBZ onto a 2.5 or 5 dBZ grid
// before it looks up a colour. Inside a bin every gate paints the identical
// colour, which is why the display draws flat plateaus with hard edges between
// them. That is a deliberate reading aid - the edges are contours of constant
// reflectivity, and an analyst can count them - but it is also indistinguishable
// from a renderer that cannot interpolate. With nothing but stepped tables in
// the picker there was no way to tell the two apart from the scope.
//
// So these three are the same field seen the other way: no quantisation, and
// enough stops that the ramp reads as a gradient. Between them and the stepped
// presets, banding that survives a switch to an interpolated table is the
// renderer's, and banding that does not is the palette's.
//
// All three keep the four break points people actually read reflectivity by.
// Under the Marshall-Palmer relation Z = 200 R^1.6 (Marshall, J. S., and
// W. M. Palmer, 1948: "The distribution of raindrops with size", J. Meteor., 5,
// 165-166, doi:10.1175/1520-0469(1948)005<0165:TDORWS>2.0.CO;2) those dBZ
// values are rain rates that mean something different from each other:
//
// * 20 dBZ -> 0.65 mm/h. Precipitation onset; below it is drizzle, cloud, and
//   the clear-air return of insects and dust (Fabry, F., 2015: "Radar
//   Meteorology: Principles and Practice", Cambridge Univ. Press,
//   doi:10.1017/CBO9781107707405, ch. 8).
// * 35 dBZ -> 5.6 mm/h. Moderate-to-heavy rain; in convection this is the edge
//   of the core.
// * 50 dBZ -> 49 mm/h. Torrential rain or hail. Near the 45-50 dBZ thresholds
//   the operational hail algorithms are built on (Waldvogel, A., B. Federer,
//   and P. Grimm, 1979: "Criteria for the detection of hail cells", J. Appl.
//   Meteor., 18, 1521-1525,
//   doi:10.1175/1520-0450(1979)018<1521:CFTDOH>2.0.CO;2; Witt, A., and
//   coauthors, 1998: "An enhanced hail detection algorithm for the WSR-88D",
//   Wea. Forecasting, 13, 286-303,
//   doi:10.1175/1520-0434(1998)013<0286:AEHDAF>2.0.CO;2).
// * 65 dBZ -> 420 mm/h, which no rain shaft produces. At 65 dBZ the target is
//   large hail, and saying so is the whole point of the last band.
//
// A gradient that smears those four away is prettier than a stepped table and
// worse at the job, so all three place a half-dBZ turn on each one - one data
// step wide, since Level II reflectivity is quantised to 0.5 dBZ - and run a
// true gradient in between. The result is four thin contours where an analyst
// wants contours, and continuous tone everywhere else. Smooth Classic and
// Smooth Storm Core turn hue; Smooth Sequential steps luminance up, which is
// what lets it keep a monotone lightness ramp and still show the thresholds.
//
// All three also ink from 10 dBZ, exactly like the stepped presets, so
// switching between them changes how the echo is coloured. The half-dBZ alpha
// ramp below 10 dBZ is one Level II step wide; it exists because an
// interpolated table cannot have a discontinuity, not to fade anything in.
//
// On raw Level II values nothing lands inside that ramp: the 8-bit reflectivity
// word decodes as (raw - 66) / 2, so every value a radar can send sits exactly
// on the 0.5 dBZ grid, and 9.5 and 10.0 are both grid points. That is NOT true
// once the display passes run. `render2d::smooth` (a 3x3 binomial on the polar
// lattice) and `render2d::interpolate` (bilinear inter-gate upsampling) both
// produce physical values off the 0.5 grid, and a NaN-aware [1 2 1] pass along
// range over KABR 2026-08-18 06:43:14Z put 74,932 of 3,799,008 gates strictly
// inside 9.5 < dBZ < 10.0, and over KDMX 2026-08-18 08:34:01Z 59,827 of
// 5,025,389 - one to two percent, all of them at the outer fringe of the echo.
// Those gates draw at partial alpha on these three tables and fully clear on
// every quantised preset, whose `sample` returns transparent below its first
// opaque stop outright. So in Soften or Interpolate display modes an echo edge
// is one half-dBZ softer here than on a stepped table; the interior, which is
// what the palette is being judged on, is unaffected.
// `the_interpolated_reflectivity_presets_ink_the_same_gates_as_the_stepped_ones`
// pins both halves of that: identical on the 0.5 dBZ grid, half-alpha off it.
//
// At the top they run to 95 rather than the stepped presets' 92.5, because
// that same encoding tops out at (255 - 66) / 2 = 94.5 dBZ. The last stop is
// past the last value the field can hold, so nothing is ever clamped onto it
// and the legend's upper bound is a number the data can actually reach.

/// The classic radar hue order is not monotone in lightness: yellow at 40 dBZ
/// is far lighter than the dark red at 60, so a storm's strongest gates are
/// *darker* than its moderate ones and the eye has to be told the order rather
/// than seeing it. Worse for the job in hand, a ramp that goes light-dark-light
/// hides small gradients wherever it doubles back.
///
/// This one is built the way the colour-map literature says a sequential scale
/// should be: lightness rising monotonically end to end, hue carrying the rest
/// of the information (Kovesi, P., 2015: "Good colour maps: how to design
/// them", arXiv:1509.03700; Crameri, F., G. E. Shephard, and P. J. Heron, 2020:
/// "The misuse of colour in science communication", Nat. Commun., 11, 5444,
/// doi:10.1038/s41467-020-19160-x). Lightness is the BT.709 relative luminance
/// 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B, and a test checks it rises at every one of
/// the 32 inked stops.
///
/// Two consequences worth knowing before reaching for it. Strongest is always
/// brightest, so a core reads as a peak in a relief map rather than as a colour
/// to be looked up. And because lightness never doubles back, the palette
/// cannot stall: on a stepped table a plateau might be the palette's bin or the
/// renderer's, and here there is nowhere for the palette to plateau.
///
/// The four break points are turns here, exactly as on Smooth Classic REF, and
/// this was got wrong the first time. The original stops moved 3-8 units of
/// colour across each break window - *less* than the 8 units the widest
/// ordinary half-dBZ window moved, and at 20 dBZ less than the window
/// immediately before it - so 49.5 dBZ and 50.5 dBZ were the same orange and
/// the core boundary was invisible. Measured on KABR 2026-08-18 06:43:14Z and
/// KDMX 2026-08-18 08:34:01Z, whose reflectivity fields between them hold 119
/// and 123 distinct dBZ values above 10 dBZ.
///
/// Monotone lightness does not require a smooth ramp, only a rising one, so
/// each break is now a step *up*: luminance jumps 15 to 40 units in the half
/// dBZ below 20, 35, 50 and 65, against 1 to 5 units for an ordinary half-dBZ
/// window. Every break window moves at least twelve times as far as the worst
/// non-break window, and `the_contour_tables_turn_at_the_four_breaks_and_glide_between_them`
/// holds all three interpolated presets to the same bar.
///
/// The hue story is unchanged: indigo at the bottom, violet from 20, red from
/// 35, amber from 50, near-white from 65.
