//! Scene policy for the raster tile basemap.
//!
//! This is the half of the tile layer that decides *what* to draw: which tile
//! zoom a pane is at, which tiles that pane can see, which texture stands in
//! for one that has not arrived, and what the imagery is dimmed with so the
//! radar stays readable on top of it. It owns the [`TileStore`] and the mesh
//! cache. There is no wgpu here — the GPU half is [`crate::tile_gpu`], and it
//! only executes the draw list this produces.
//!
//! # What this layer is not allowed to do
//!
//! The imagery is an addition, never a replacement. When no provider is
//! selected, when the camera is coarser than [`basemap_tiles::MIN_TILE_ZOOM`],
//! when there is no radar anchor, or when every fetch fails, this returns
//! `None` and the pane is byte for byte the vector-only pane that shipped.
//! That degrade path is reached deliberately in each of those cases rather
//! than by accident.
//!
//! # Zoom selection, and why it is derived from the LOD bucket
//!
//! Rounding `log2` of the raw camera scale — what the sibling application does
//! — has no hysteresis: a camera parked on a rounding boundary flips zoom
//! every frame, and each flip discards one whole tile set and requests
//! another. This workspace already solved that problem once, for vector
//! geometry, in `analyst_runtime::LodSelector` (half-octave buckets, 12%
//! hysteresis). [`tile_zoom_for`] therefore reads the bucket's *centre* scale,
//! never the instantaneous camera scale, which makes the tile zoom a pure
//! function of `(LodBucket, anchor latitude, pixels_per_point)` and lets the
//! tile layer inherit that selector's hysteresis. A pan cannot change the tile
//! zoom, and a zoom inside a bucket cannot either — structurally, not merely
//! in practice.
