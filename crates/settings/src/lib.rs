//! The workstation's persisted settings: a typed, contributed registry of
//! knobs and a crash-safe, forward-compatible store for their values.
//!
//! Three layers, bottom to top, and the reason each exists:
//!
//! * [`registry`] - the *shape* of a setting. A module that owns a capability
//!   declares a [`SettingsCategory`] - plain data: an id, a label and a list
//!   of typed items with ranges and defaults - and the master settings window
//!   renders whatever was declared. This is the white-label plumbing: a crate
//!   ported from BowEcho tomorrow declares its settings the same way and they
//!   appear in the menu with zero changes to the menu code. No trait objects,
//!   no macros; declarations are values.
//! * [`store`] - the persisted *values*, keyed by `(category id, setting id)`,
//!   plus a structured [`WorkspaceSnapshot`] for state that is not a scalar
//!   knob (pane products, cameras, palettes, the last site). The store is
//!   versioned, keeps every field it does not understand so a file written by
//!   a future build survives a round trip through this one, writes atomically
//!   so a crash mid-save cannot corrupt the file, and debounces saves so no
//!   caller ever saves per frame.
//! * [`paths`] - where the file lives. The base directory is injectable
//!   because an iOS or Android shell has to hand the sandbox path in; the
//!   desktop defaults follow the conventions the rest of this workspace
//!   already uses (`LOCALAPPDATA/FahrenheitResearch/RadarWorkstation` on
//!   Windows, XDG on Linux).
//!
//! This crate deliberately depends on nothing but serde. It sits at the
//! bottom of the workspace so that any crate - including ones that do not
//! exist yet - can depend on it to declare settings without creating a cycle.
//! See `docs/extending.md` for the full contribution contract.
