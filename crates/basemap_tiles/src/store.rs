//! Fetching, caching and decoding tiles, off the UI thread.
//!
//! [`TileStore`] itself is single-threaded and lives on whichever thread drives
//! the scene: `request`, `retain` and `drain_ready` all take `&mut self`. The
//! work happens on a small pool of worker threads that share a bounded,
//! newest-first queue.
//!
//! # The three failure modes this is shaped around
//!
//! **A fast pan must not become a denial of service.** Dragging across the
//! country at z12 sweeps thousands of tiles. Without [`TileStore::retain`],
//! every one of them stays queued and is fetched long after the user stopped
//! looking at it — which for OpenStreetMap is precisely the bulk downloading
//! its policy blocks accounts for. `retain` is called every frame with the
//! union of all panes' wanted sets and drops queued jobs *before* they reach
//! the network.
//!
//! **A firewalled machine must not generate a heartbeat of doomed
//! connections.** A failed tile backs off 5 s, 15 s, 60 s and then stops for
//! the session. It does not retry on a flat interval forever.
//!
//! **Offline must be silent, not broken.** With
//! [`TileCacheConfig::offline`] set, the store serves whatever the disk cache
//! holds, never opens a socket — the HTTP client is not even constructed — and
//! never records a failure. A pane with no tiles is simply today's pane.
