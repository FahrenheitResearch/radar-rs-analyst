//! Turning a Web Mercator tile into geometry in the radar-local frame.
//!
//! # Why a tile is not two triangles
//!
//! A tile is an axis-aligned rectangle in EPSG:3857. The radar frame is a
//! geodesic azimuthal-equidistant projection (Snyder 1987, pp. 191-202,
//! evaluated with Vincenty 1975). Under that map a Mercator parallel is a
//! curve, not a line, and the transverse scale factor `rho / (R sin(rho/R))`
//! varies across the tile. Drawing the tile as two textured triangles — the
//! corner-projection approach most viewers use — therefore leaves a residual
//! that grows with tile size and with distance from the anchor.
//!
//! Measured, for the real sites this application is exercised against and at
//! the sharpest camera scale the selecting LOD bucket admits, corner
//! projection alone is wrong by roughly 45-70 screen pixels at z4, 16-29 at
//! z5, 6-13 at z6 and 3-6 at z7. It only becomes acceptable around z10. That
//! is not a rounding error; it is county lines sliding off the imagery.
//!
//! So [`build_tile_mesh`] subdivides until the piecewise-affine surface is
//! within [`crate::SUBDIVISION_TOLERANCE_TEXELS`] of the truth, and records
//! what it achieved in [`TileMesh::max_error_km`] so the bound can be asserted
//! by a test rather than trusted.
//!
//! # The invariant that makes this cheap
//!
//! The subdivision depends on the tile and on the projection and on **nothing
//! else**. No camera centre, no camera scale. A mesh is therefore cacheable on
//! `(TileId, projection identity)`, exactly as the vector basemap's retained
//! geometry is, and a pan or a zoom inside one LOD bucket reuses it untouched.
