//! Draw a sweep that is still arriving on top of the last complete one.
//!
//! A live volume arrives in chunks. Part way through a tilt the radar has
//! looked at, say, 240 of the 360 azimuths it will eventually deliver, and the
//! remaining wedge holds no data yet. Painting that wedge empty tells the
//! viewer "there is no storm there", when the truth is only "the antenna has
//! not come round to there yet this pass". On a real KTLX 2026-08-17 07:24:02
//! VCP 212 partial cut the hole was 121 degrees wide and it straddled the
//! 0/360 seam (radials ran from 197.5 degrees upward, wrapping through zero and
//! ending at 76.5), so a third of the display would have blinked out once per
//! volume. Wrap handling is the normal case here, not an edge case.
//!
//! The fix is to under-paint the unswept wedge with the previous complete sweep
//! of the same tilt. New data then wipes over old clockwise, like the trace on
//! a PPI scope, and the picture is never blank.
//!
//! # What decides ownership of a pixel
//!
//! Ownership is decided purely by ANGLE, never by "does the incoming sweep
//! happen to have data here". Two failures follow from getting that wrong:
//!
//! * The incoming sweep's azimuth lookup deliberately smears its first and last
//!   radial up to 3 degrees outward to close the gaps between radials. If the
//!   presence of data decided ownership, that smear would paint a 3 degree
//!   tongue of new data over the old sweep at both ends of the arc, so the
//!   leading edge would look ragged and would jitter frame to frame.
//! * Inside the swept arc a gate with no echo means the echo is GONE. Falling
//!   back to the previous sweep there would resurrect a storm that has actually
//!   moved on or dissipated, which is a worse lie than an empty wedge.
//!
//! So: inside the revealed arc the incoming sweep is authoritative even where
//! it is empty; outside it, the previous sweep shows through untouched.
//!
//! # Where `revealed_deg` comes from
//!
//! Not from this module, and never from a hardcoded rate. Radial
//! `time_offset_ms` is ANTENNA time, not arrival time: a chunk hands over about
//! 240 radials at once but their timestamps are evenly spaced (measured p50 gap
//! 20-36 ms, max 38 ms, zero gaps over 200 ms on all 19 cuts of the volume
//! above). Antenna rate therefore has to be measured per cut, because it is not
//! constant across a VCP: 16.5 deg/s on 720-radial Doppler legs, 22.3 deg/s on
//! 720-radial surveillance legs, and 27.9-30.2 deg/s on the 360-radial upper
//! cuts of that same volume. The caller measures it and passes the result in.
//!
//! # Geometry
//!
//! Every pixel-to-gate decision here is made by the crate's own viewport
//! rasteriser types (`ViewportLookupTable`, `AzimuthLookup`, `color_for_raw`),
//! not by a re-derivation, so this raster registers pixel-for-pixel with the
//! normal path and cannot drift away from it. The only thing computed locally
//! is the pixel's compass azimuth for the reveal test, and that calls the same
//! `azimuth_from_xy` on the same `dx`/`dy` the lookup uses.
//!
//! # Velocity
//!
//! Velocity is not painted straight off the grid the way reflectivity is. Two
//! transforms sit between the stored code and the colour, and each of them is a
//! property of a WHOLE sweep rather than of a gate, so each of them has to be
//! decided for the two layers separately and then reconciled:
//!
//! * Dealiasing unfolds a radial against its Nyquist interval by chaining gate
//!   to gate from a seed, so it cannot run on a grid that does not exist yet.
//!   The arriving sweep is unfolded as the partial sweep it is and the previous
//!   sweep as the complete sweep it was, independently. See
//!   [`DealiasedSweepBlend`], which exists so that no caller can unfold one half
//!   of a picture and not the other.
//! * Storm-relative velocity subtracts the projection of a storm motion vector
//!   onto each radial's beam. That subtraction is applied to BOTH layers from
//!   the SAME vector, because a reveal boundary with one frame of reference on
//!   each side of it is a fabricated velocity discontinuity in the shape of a
//!   straight radial line. See [`render_storm_relative_sweep_blend_rgba_into`].
//!
//! Both are shading decisions and neither is a geometry decision: ownership of a
//! pixel is still decided by angle alone, both layers still go through the same
//! `ViewportLookupTable` as the ordinary rasteriser, and a fully revealed blend
//! of either kind is still byte-identical to the ordinary raster of the same
//! sweep.
