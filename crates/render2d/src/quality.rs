//! Supersampled rasterising and box downsampling for the viewport path.
//!
//! The base viewport rasteriser takes exactly one nearest-neighbour sample per
//! screen pixel (`ViewportLookupRow::lookup`). That is a point sample of a
//! signal whose bandwidth has nothing to do with the screen grid: zoomed out a
//! single pixel spans several gates radially and dozens of radials
//! azimuthally, so the one sample that survives is essentially arbitrary and
//! the sweep breaks up into speckle and dashed radials. Supersampling —
//! rasterising at an integer multiple of the display grid and box-filtering
//! back down — is the standard cure (Crow 1981, "A Comparison of Antialiasing
//! Techniques", IEEE CG&A 1(1) 40-48, doi:10.1109/MCG.1981.167381).
//!
//! The filter averages in PREMULTIPLIED (Porter & Duff's "associated") alpha.
//! Averaging straight RGBA is the classic wrong answer: the RGB of a fully
//! transparent pixel is meaningless, and in this rasteriser it is black, so a
//! straight average drags every echo edge toward black and rings each storm
//! with a dark fringe. See Porter & Duff 1984, "Compositing Digital Images",
//! SIGGRAPH '84, Computer Graphics 18(3) 253-259, doi:10.1145/800031.808606,
//! and Blinn 1994, "Compositing, Part 1: Theory", IEEE CG&A 14(5) 83-87,
//! doi:10.1109/38.310740.
//!
//! REGISTRATION. `ViewportRasterOptions::radar_x_px` is a pixel-CORNER
//! coordinate: the rasteriser samples pixel `x` at ground offset
//! `(x + 0.5 - radar_x_px) * km_per_px_x`, so the radar itself sits on the
//! boundary between pixels `radar_x_px - 1` and `radar_x_px`. Scaling that
//! coordinate by the plain factor `s` therefore maps base pixel `i` onto
//! exactly the supersampled block `[s·i, s·i + s)`, and the box filter over
//! that block covers exactly the ground the base pixel covered. Mixing in a
//! pixel-CENTRE convention here — `(radar_x_px + 0.5)·s - 0.5` — would shift
//! the image by half a base pixel at every factor. The test
//! `real_volume_subsample_planes_land_where_a_plain_render_would_sample` pins
//! the correct convention against sixteen from-scratch renders of a live
//! sweep, and shows the centre convention failing the same comparison.
//!
//! [`ViewportRasterOptions`] lives in the crate root, so the scaling is offered
//! as free functions here rather than as an inherent method.

/// This is a BYTE budget rather than BowEcho's per-dimension ceiling. BowEcho
/// caps each dimension at 4096 because its supersampled raster is uploaded as
/// a wgpu texture and resampled by the hardware; nothing here is a texture —

/// combined with the integer floor this path needs (see
/// [`effective_supersample_factor`]), `4096 / 2560 = 1` means every viewport
/// wider than 2048 px silently gets no supersampling at all, which is most of
/// a maximised pane on a 1440p or 4K display. The byte budget admits
/// 2560x1440 at 2x (56.25 MiB) while leaving the worst-case allocation
